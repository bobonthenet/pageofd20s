I wrote this in about 2 minutes to serve a specific purpose. I'm not likely to update or modify this since it already serves my needs, but if you submit a pull request I'll definitely check it out. I had thought this would be cool as a console app so I might do that in the future but I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for it.
